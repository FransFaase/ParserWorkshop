# Workshop: A modern approach to parsing

This workshop was held online on March 20, 2021 as part of the CyberSaturdays of
[TkkrLab](https://tkkrlab.nl/). <A HREF="https://youtu.be/KxAjxg4yPRM">The recording
of the workshop</A>.

The workshop consists of:
* [Introduction and history of parsing](https://fransfaase.github.io/ParserWorkshop/index.html#intro)
* Tutorial on writting grammars with [an online interactive parser](https://fransfaase.github.io/ParserWorkshop/Online_inter_parser.html)
* Presentation of [IParse](https://github.com/FransFaase/IParse)
* Presentation of [RawParser](https://github.com/FransFaase/RawParser)

Afterwards, I was a little disappointed about the workshop,
because it turned out to be more of a lecture. I also realized that I should have
started with the expression example, which <A HREF="https://youtu.be/KxAjxg4yPRM?t=1342"
>starts around 22:22</A> and from their explain priorities, show the abstract
syntax tree, and explain how to develop the grammar in a number of steps. And
this followed by some more about the history of parsing and how I came to
develop IParse. (There were also some technical issues with the sound, which
forced me to use a MacBook from someone else to give the presentation, not
allowing me to show some of the commands.)
